        <p>
            My name is Flipse (she/her), I'm {age} and autistic. My special subject is music + making
            lists with data, so I thoroughly enjoyed discovering <a
                href="https://record.club/mournstera/">Record.Club</a
            > recently. I have a good handful of diagnoses including bipolar, which, alongside my
            late-diagnosed autism, is the film director of most of my life, hence why I'm an early
            disability retiree.
        </p>

        <p>I do love concerts, watermelon, Doctor Who, and TTRPG.</p>

        <h3>Early Web Days</h3>
        <p>
            I clicked on "view source" on a website as many others did in 1999, and later found
            b2/cafelog and <em>online diaries</em>. As a christmas, my parents got their 12 year
            old her own domain, webhost - you know, a totally normal gift for a kid who made her
            own database of license plates (began that one in 1993), and film she had watched
            (IMDB wasn't good enough).
        </p>

        <h3>Tumblr Era</h3>
        <p>
            I was offline for a few years, but found Tumblr in 2009, and began releasing my own
            Tumblr themes around 2012, while attempting to wrangle their <em>interesting</em> choices
            of code. In late 2025, I decided that Tumblr was neither my circus nor my monkeys.

        <p>
            Primarily the reasons for quitting, were influenced by <a

            >.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Adventures</h3>
        <p>
            I'm untangling years of - let's be real for a second - <em>questionable</em> JavaScript
            habits courtesy of Tumblr. I have only recently discovered Astro, so this site is very
            basic and very much my future playground!
