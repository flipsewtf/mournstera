        <h2>Well hi there!</h2>

        <p class="quick-facts">
            My name is Flipse (she/her), I'm {age} and autistic. My special subject is music + making lists,
            so I thoroughly enjoyed discovering <a href="https://record.club/mournstera/">Record.Club</a>.
            I Have bipolar disorder and cptsd with a pinch of OCD when times are hard. My sidequest of
            getting 30 years of anxiety attacks under control, just ended in victory!
        </p>

        <p>I like concerts, watermelon, Doctor Who, and TTRPG.</p>

        <h3>Early Web Days</h3>
        <p>
            I began my journey with b2/cafelog and "online diaries" (before the term <em>blog</em> was coined)
            around 1999/2000, complete with a domain, webrings, and fanlistings.
        </p>

        <h3>Tumblr Era</h3>
        <p>
            From 2007 I didn't really touch any code, but I found Tumblr in 2009, and from 2012 when I
            began releasing Tumblr themes while attempting to wrangle their quirks and <em>interesting</em
            > choices of code. As of late 2025, I've walked away from that circus.
        </p>

        <h3>Current Adventures</h3>
        <p>
            Lately, I've been exploring elsewhere with Astro, Neocities, and general fun stuff on the web.
            Currently untangling years of - let's be honest - questionable JavaScript habits courtesy of
            Tumblr. I have only recently discovered Astro, so this site is very basic and very much my
            future playground. I will write a more interesting About Me-page at some point.
