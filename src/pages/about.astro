        <p>
            My name is Flipse and my pronouns are she/her. I'm a {age}-year-old Danish, bi,
            autistic, and cis woman. My special subject is music, but also making lists with data,
            so I thoroughly enjoyed discovering <a href="https://record.club/mournstera/"
                >Record.Club</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a good handful of… <em>interesting</em> diagnoses, including bipolar and late-diagnosed
            autism—that one explained the yearly burnouts—both frame most of my everyday life. I am now
            an early disability retiree (2022), navigating all of this in a meaningful way.
        </p>

        <p>I love concerts, watermelon, Doctor Who, and TTRPGs.</p>

        <h4>Early Web Days</h4>
        <p>
            Like many others, I clicked on “view source” on a website somewhere around 1999, and
            later found b2/cafelog and <em>online diaries</em>. At Christmas, my parents got their
            12-year-old her own domain and web host—a totally normal gift for a kid who made her own
            database of licence plates (began that one in 1993, was informed it was in fact illegal
            to keep a record lol), and films she had watched (IMDb wasn’t great back then).
        </p>

        <h4>Tumblr</h4>
        <p>
            I found Tumblr in 2009, and began releasing my own Tumblr themes around 2012 while
            attempting to wrangle their <em>interesting</em> choices of code. I carefully built my audience
            (18k followers) and a lot of happy users and friends over the years.
        </p>

        <p>
            In late 2025, I decided that Tumblr was neither my circus nor my monkeys anymore.
            Primarily, the reasons for quitting were influenced by <a

        <h4>Current Adventures</h4>
        <p>
            I'm untangling years of—let’s be real for a second here—<em>questionable</em> JavaScript
            habits courtesy of Tumblr. I discovered Astro, and the rest is now history, I guess.
